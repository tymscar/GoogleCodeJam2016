# Google CodeJam 2016

This repo includes my try at the qualification round for the *Google CodeJam* project.

Only had the time to try 2 out of the 4 problems which I did resolved correctly. Hopefuly, next year, I will have enough time to try all the 4 problems.

Feel free to take a look at my approach!

### Compiling

I added the *main.cpp* file for both of the programs so you can compile it using any *IDE* you want. Alternatively you can compile in your terminal of choice:

```sh
$ gcc main.cpp -lstdc++
```
Then read the a.out file.
